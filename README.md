## Exercise 1
- need to create object literal to store the key/value pairs of the letters and their corresponding leet number
- iterate through each letter in the string provided and check if it matches any of the keys required
- wasn't too sure if I needed to have the uppercase accounted for in the objects but did it anyway for consistency.
- Exercise instruction might have had a typo as the last set was "b, D = 5"

## Exercise 2
- A little more challenging
- adding to the count and also keeping the initial char of each set of letters was the trick
- tried to initially create an object and set aside an array of the initial letters and a separate value pair for the set of counts of those letters
